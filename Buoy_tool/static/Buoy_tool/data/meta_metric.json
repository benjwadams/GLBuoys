These include major contributions from the City of South Haven, Van Buren County, and Entergy Palisades Nuclear Plant. Other organizations supporting annual maintenance costs include the South Haven Yacht Club, South Haven Steelheaders, South Haven Convention and Visitors Bureau, Covert Generating Station, US Coast Guard Auxiliary, River Bend Boat Club, South Haven Kiwanis, Tournament Trail 333, and the South Haven Chamber of Commerce.<br><br>The South Haven Steelheaders are supporting the addition of a string of nine temperature sensors below the buoy to report water temperatures in real-time. WOOD-TV out of Grand Rapids is supporting the addition of a high definition webcam to the buoy to provide hourly images and video clips. Padnos Metal Recycling of Holland has donated two recycled train wheels to be used as the permanent mooring anchor for the buoy. The NOAA field research station in Muskegon, MI is supporting the deployment of the mooring anchor and the buoy by donating use of its 80 ft research vessel, the R/V Laurentian.",

This buoy also marks a first with a unique cooperative formed for the buoy's maintenance and care.  The communities of Harbor Springs and Petoskey have collaborated to create a support organization that will be responsible for the deployment/retrieval and small maintenance of this buoy.  Although the buoy was funded by the Great Lakes Observing System (GLOS), this local cooperative has made it possible to annually deploy the buoy.  The OEL would like to thank Irish Boat Shop, Walstrom Marine, Bay Harbor Lake Marina, Bay Harbor Yacht Club, Little Traverse Yacht Club and the Cities of Harbor Springs, Petoskey, and Charlevoix for contributing.  The buoy measures wind speed and direction, air and surface water temperature, barometric pressure, solar radiation, and wave height, period and direction.",

We strive to make our drinking water and wastewater treatment systems among the most progressive in the country. When zebra mussels invaded the Great Lakes in the \u201880s, Avon Lake was the region\u2019s first utility to innovate methods of preventing mussels from obstructing raw water intakes. One of the newest threats we protect you from is toxic algae. We are putting effort into learning more about microcystin and other toxins found in harmful algal blooms (HABs) and are putting into pace this year new \u2018clearwell\u2019 storage tanks and will be adding additional pumping and emergency power generation factilities. We will also rehabilitate several filters to improve treatment ability and convert some existing basins to allow water to be recycled within the plant and reduce the burden on the wastewater treatment facility\u2014thereby further reducing your wastewater\u2019s impact on Lake Erie.",

The pump station can be either locally or remotely operated by signals sent from the water treatment plant. The pumps located at the station range from 8 million gallons per day (MGD) to 17.2 MGD. Activated carbon is fed at this location to address taste and odor causing agents in the raw water. The building also contains an auxiliary power plant capable of generating total electrical power for the station. Since the onset of the Zebra Mussel infestation in Lake Erie, it is necessary to feed potassium permanganate to limit their growth in the intake conduit, the low pressure force main and the suction wells.",

"buoyInfo": "An extensive fish kill occurred in the late summer of 2012 on the north shore of the central basin. This fish kill was a result of the influx of oxygen-depleted offshore bottom water. This event raised the awareness that normal lake mixing processes can circulate poor quality hypolimnetic lake water (i.e. hypoxic) into the nearshore zone and adversely affect the ecosystem and water users. Motivated by this concern a real-time buoy equipped with sensors for the detection of oxygen concentrations and cyanobacteria pigments was deployed in nearshore of the Central Basin in the summer of 2016. The buoy is to be deployed annually from spring to fall. In 2013, blooms of cyanobacteria distinct from those in the western basin were detected in the central basin and on the north shore. While these central basin blooms were limited in comparison to those in the western basin, the environmental conditions of the central basin, mesotrophic with occasional upwelling of SRP-rich water, suggest that there is a possibility of increasing problems with cyanobacteria in the central basin from basin-specific blooms adding to the concern of transport of cyanobacteria from the western basin. The water quality data collected from the Central Basin buoy is envisaged to serve multiple purposes. The first purpose is to assist in documenting and interpreting the risk of upwelling of oxygen-depleted (hypoxic) water into the nearshore waters of the north shore. The data stream from the buoy will assist in tracking and explaining adverse water quality events resulting from upwelling of hypoxic water. Adverse effects associated with hypoxic upwelling include a fish kill or diminished source water quality and odourous water. The third purpose is to track the development cyanobacteria blooms that may move onto the Ontario shoreline. An overall objective is to better understand the link between central basin hypoxia, upwelling and north shore water quality, and to indirectly track changes in the condition of the central basin as a result changes in nutrient management, or negatively as affected by climate change.",

"buoyInfo": "Much of the shallow nearshore of Lake Ontario is overgrown seasonally with the benthic algae Cladophora, which periodically fouls shoreline when it dies back or is detached by wave action. Monitoring and research to better understand the reasons for the proliferation of benthic algae in Lake Ontario since the colonization of the lake by dreissenid mussels has been ongoing for some time. A real-time buoy equipped with sensors for the measurement water quality features and currents at the lakebed and in the water column was deployed in nearshore of the Lake Ontario in the summer of 2008 in support of this work. The buoy is located on the north shore in an area which has experienced periodic shore fouling and where the lakebed is characterized by high coverage of Cladophora and dreissenid mussels. The buoy is to be deployed annually from spring to fall and positioned over the lakebed covered by dreissenid mussels. The installation consists of sensors mounted on a surface buoy and bottom frame. The sensor measurements near the lake surface provide information on area water quality. Conductivity, chlorophyll a fluorescence and turbidity sensors allow patterns in lake conditions and intrusion of water loaded from further inshore to be detected. Current measurement and temperature provide insight on lake circulation and enable detection of upwelling and downwelling events which frequently affect physical and water quality conditions on this shoreline. The bottom frame, with sensors mounted at 10 cm and 1 m from the lakebed, measure chlorophyll a fluorescence, turbidity and temperature, providing insight on conditions above the lakebed as affected by lake circulation and biological activity on the lakebed. A down-looking ADCP mounted on the frame measures circulation above the lakebed. In the years since the acquisition of the buoy the focus has enlarged to include general surveillance of water quality and physical lake conditions in nearshore of Lake Ontario adjacent to a growing urban area where nearshore water resources are heavily used.",

"buoyInfo": "The nearshore of Lake Ontario adjacent to the Greater Toronto Area is critically important to the large population that lives near the shores of the lake and rely on the lake as a source of drinking water and as a receiver of treated domestic sewage. Urban rivers discharging to the nearshore and numerous other drainage outlets at the shores of the lake make the coastline sensitive to upstream inputs linked to human activity and weather-related events that affect water quality. A real-time buoy equipped with sensors for the measurement of water quality features and currents through the water column was deployed in the nearshore of Lake Ontario on the shores of the City of Toronto in the summer of 2013. The buoy is located on the western shores of the City near the border with the City of Mississauga and positioned offshore of an area high urban development and appreciable water resource usage. The buoy is to be deployed annually from spring to fall. Its purpose is surveillance of water quality and physical lake conditions in an area adjacent to a large urban area where nearshore water resources are heavily used. The installation consists of sensors mounted on a surface buoy, two nodes within the water column and on a bottom frame. The sensors measurements are designed to capture multiple aspects of lake conditions. Temperature sensors at four points through the water column, a surface current meter and an upward-looking ADCP mounted on the bottom frame provide information on water column stratification and circulation. Conductivity and turbidity sensors at points through the water column are used to detect intrusion of water masses affected by runoff or discharges. General lake water quality is inferred from the measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence, turbidity and temperature. Sensors measuring fluorescence of cyanobacteria pigment along with the chlorophyll a fluorescence provides data to indirectly track the abundance of phytoplankton offering insights on possible algae-related problems.",
